# Vimrc for Programmers

This is my vimrc inspired from [Amix's The Ultimate vimrc][1] but using [Vundle][2]
as plugin manager.

## Usage

- Clone from GitHub:

``` sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/vfreex/vimrc ~/.vim
```

- Edit `~/.vim/vimrc` for the list of plugins to install. Please read the document of [Vundle][2]
carefully before making any change to the file.

``` sh
vim ~/.vim/vimrc
```
- Install plugins

``` sh
vim
:VundleInstall
```
